# Classification-of-species-of-Iris-flower
I have classified the species the iris flower from the famous Iris dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). The dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from the different species. There are four columns: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width in cm measurement scale. The fifth column represents the Species of the iris flower. I used the following popular machine learning (ML) models here.
1. Logistic Regression, 
2. Support Vector machine (SVM), 
3. Linear SVC Classifier,
4. SVM with SGD, and 
5. Decision Tree \
Upon the evaluation, the SVM with the grid search classifies the species of the iris data set with higher accuracy of 1.00 among the five ML algorithms used here. On the other side, the SVM with SGD classifier seems to have the lowest accuracy (~ 0.56) among all.
  I also implemented the Tensorflow Deep Learning model finally.
